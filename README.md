# odin-recipes
The odin project HTML section 1st assignment

Created a simple project with a Home page which has 3 recipes listed.
3 recipes are linked that take user to those specific pages using links.
Different heading tags were used as well.
Used unordered and ordered lists to showcase different types of content.
Images were also added to make the page a bit more engaging.
